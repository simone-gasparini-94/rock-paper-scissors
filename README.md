# rock-paper-scissors
First Project with JS

The project is the creation of a rock, paper, scissors game using javascript.

The code start with two global variables that set the score for both the player and computer to 0.

Then the code is divided in 4 functions:
- function for making the player choose between rock, paper, scissors through a prompt
- function for assigning a random choice to the computer using Math.random method multiplied by 3
- function for deciding the winner through and if else statement
- function with a for loop set to 5 to play 5 rounds

Updated the code so that the player can click on a button to select rock, paper or scissors instead of choosing through a prompt
